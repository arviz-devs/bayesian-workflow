# Bayesian Workflow resources
For now this is a playground for resources about the Bayesian workflow.
Our idea is to host a collaborative website with up to date advise,
best practices and references that can be shared between multiple
programming and probabilistic programming languages.

The common text should be common, with the code in synced tabs
with optionally some very short specific notes. For detailed
library specific notes, each library should have an extension page
that can then be linked here.
